This package helps you view ASCII/ANSI colors while writing game content.

After cloning, you should probably do an `npm install`, then from a terminal run `nodemon index.js`, and open index.js also in a text editor side by side. 

From here, any changes you make to `index.js` are immediately reflected in the terminal upon saving. When you use a hotkey to save, it makes the process of experimenting with colors and descriptions fairly fast.
